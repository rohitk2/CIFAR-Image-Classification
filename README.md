# CIFAR-10 Image Classifier

## Overview

This project involves building and training a neural network to classify images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, providing a foundation for evaluating image classification models.

### Objectives
- Achieve an accuracy greater than **45%** to meet baseline requirements.
- Optionally aim to exceed **70% accuracy** to outperform Detectocorp's benchmark algorithm.

### Benchmarks
Some notable results on CIFAR-10 include:
- **78.9% Accuracy**: [Deep Belief Networks; Krizhevsky, 2010](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/conv-cifar10-aug2010.pdf)
- **90.6% Accuracy**: [Maxout Networks; Goodfellow et al., 2013](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.4389.pdf)
- **96.0% Accuracy**: [Wide Residual Networks; Zagoruyko et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.07146.pdf)
- **99.0% Accuracy**: [GPipe; Huang et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.06965.pdf)

## Key Steps

### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
- **Dataset**: The CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded using PyTorch's `torchvision.datasets`.
- **Transformations**: Applied preprocessing transformations like normalization and data augmentation for robust training.
- **Data Loaders**: Created training and testing `DataLoader` objects using `torch.utils.data`.

### 2. Data Exploration
- Visualized sample images from the dataset using Matplotlib to understand the input dimensions and class distributions.
- Explored the effect of transformations on the dataset.

### 3. Model Design
- Designed a custom neural network architecture using PyTorch's `torch.nn` module.
- Incorporated layers like convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers for feature extraction and classification.

### 4. Training and Evaluation
- Defined a training loop to optimize the model using techniques like backpropagation and gradient descent.
- Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and loss on the test dataset.

### 5. Benchmarking
- Compared results to existing benchmarks and highlighted improvements.

## Tools and Libraries
